# 500pxPhotoShowcase

I went with a view model structure for this app so that communicating between the various fragments would be simpler.
I used a viewpager to display the expanded images; so that the user doesn't need to keep clicking in and out of the expanded images.
I used a separate fragment to display the photos information so that it could be hidden and shown quickly.

If I were to spend more time on this project:
- I would use glide instead of Picasso for the thumbnail feature.
- I would add zooming in and out to the expanded images.

Extra
- I added a download button so that it would be easier for the user to download the image.
